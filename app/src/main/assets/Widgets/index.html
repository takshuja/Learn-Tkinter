        <div class="defin">
         A widget is an element of GUI that displays information or provides a specific way for a user to interact with the operating system or an application.<br /> <br />
            In Tkinter, widgets are objects (instances of classes). When creating a widget, you must pass its parent as a parameter to the widget creation function. The only exception is the "root" window which is the top-level(main) window that will contain everything else and it does not have a parent.<br /> <br />
            Some of the most commonly used widgets are Button, Label, Entry, Frame, Checkbutton, Text, etc
