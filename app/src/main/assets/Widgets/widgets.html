            Tkinter is a standard library in Python used to create Graphical User Interface (GUI) for desktop applications. With the help of tkinter, you can easily create any sort of GUI for desktop applications.<br />
            The best thing about Tkinter is that it is cross platform meaning the same code works on multiple platforms like Linux, macOS and Windows without installing anything else.
            <br />
            It is not a thin wrapper, but adds a fair amount of it's own logic to make the experience more pythonic.

        <div class="defin">
            If you are on Windows, while installing python check the td/tk and IDLE checkbox. However, if you have missed installing tkinter, you can easily do it using "pip" command like in Linux.
            <br /><br />
            On Linux, open up the terminal, enter "pip install python3-tk" into the terminal and press enter.
            This will install the Tkinter module into your system.
